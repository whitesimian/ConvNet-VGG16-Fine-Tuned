# Fine Tuned Convolutional Neural Networks For Image Classification
Pre-trained convolutional neural networks from ImageNet, fine tuned, used for testing on a private dataset for multiclass classification of skin lesions (8 skin lesion global patterns).

Part of the pytorch code was based on "Ian Pointer - Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning, Creating and Deploying Deep Learning Applications - O'Reilly Media (2019)".
